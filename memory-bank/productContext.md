# Product Context: Baumprofis Invoice Platform

## Why This Project Exists

Baumprofis provides professional tree care services (Baumpflege, Baumsanierung, Baumfällarbeiten, etc.) throughout German regions including Koblenz and surrounding areas. As a specialized service business, professional invoicing is critical for:
- Business reputation and presentation
- Tax compliance (German VAT requirements)
- Financial record-keeping
- Customer relationship management

The current Excel-based process creates significant operational overhead and user frustration, particularly affecting productivity and employee satisfaction.

## Problems Solved

### Current Pain Points
1. **Manual Repetition**: Every invoice requires complete re-entry of customer details for repeat customers
2. **File Management Complexity**: Non-technical users struggle with Excel file locations, versions, and PDF exports
3. **Time Loss**: 15-20 minutes per invoice when using Excel manually
4. **Data Inconsistency**: Risk of errors in customer details, pricing, or VAT calculations
5. **Accessibility Barriers**: Current process excludes some employees due to technical barriers

### Business Impact Without Solution
- Reduced productivity and higher administrative costs
- Employee frustration and turnover risks
- Customer service delays from slow invoicing
- Compliance risks from manual calculation errors
- Missed growth opportunities due to operational inefficiencies

## How It Should Work
