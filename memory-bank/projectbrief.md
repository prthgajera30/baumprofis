# Baumprofis Invoice Management Platform

## Project Genesis
The Baumprofis tree care business requires a web-based invoice management system to replace manual Excel form filling. Current process involves repetitive manual data entry, file saving issues for non-technical users, and manual PDF generation.

## Core Problem
- Manual invoice creation using "Rechnung Vorlage.xlsx" template
- Customer data not persisted between invoices
- Difficult file management and PDF printing for non-technical users
- Time-consuming for repetitive customer invoicing

## Solution Vision
Build a modern, web-based platform that:
- Maintains exact fidelity to existing invoice template
- Persists customer data with intelligent search
- Enables rapid invoice creation via edit-duplicate workflow
- Provides one-click PDF generation and printing
- Offers enterprise-grade data redundancy via Firebase

## Core Requirements
1. **Template Fidelity**: Pixel-perfect replication of Excel invoice layout
2. **Customer Management**: Persistent storage with search and history
3. **Invoice Workflow**: Create new → search history → edit duplicate
4. **PDF Generation**: Accurate template reproduction with download/print
5. **User Experience**: Maximum simplicity for non-technical users
6. **Performance**: Lightning-fast interface with minimal clicks
7. **Data Reliability**: Server-side storage with automatic redundancy

## Success Metrics
- Reduce invoice creation time from 15 minutes to 3 minutes
- Zero Excel template maintenance required
- 100% PDF accuracy compared to original template
- Accessible to all employee levels without training
- Zero data loss through automatic backups

## Out of Scope
- Service templates or predefined bundles (too complex for users)
- Customer portal or external access
- Advanced accounting integrations beyond Excel export
- Multi-company support

## Business Impact
Streamline operations for a specialized tree care business, enabling employees to focus on service delivery rather than administrative tasks while maintaining professional invoice standards.
