- **No Invoice Creation**: Core functionality not developed

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Technical Stack Evolution
1. **Initial Stack**: React + custom CSS + Firebase
2. **Material UI Adoption**: Complete rewrite using only official MUI components
3. **Performance**: Bundle size ~108KB (acceptable for business app)
4. **Architecture Pattern**: PWA + Firestore optimized for fast invoice creation

### Design Philosophy Evolution
1. **Initial Design**: Complex dashboard with multiple navigation layers
2. **User Redesign**: Completely simplified to single invoice flow (login → create)
3. **Material UI Transformation**: Only official MUI components, no custom CSS
4. **Usability First**: German business standards with structured input fields

### Customer Management Evolution
1. **Phase 1**: Basic customer storage and linking
2. **Phase 2**: Fast search with autocomplete selection
3. **Phase 3**: Structured address fields (Street, ZIP, City) for German standards
4. **Current**: Auto-create customers, instant populate, reusable across invoices

### User Experience Evolution
1. **Initial Vision**: Feature-rich admin dashboard with analytics
2. **User-Centric Shift**: Mobile-first, minimal-click philosophy
3. **Accessibility Priority**: Non-technical user support above advanced features
4. **Performance First**: Sub-second responses, instant search, progressive loading

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Current (Planning Phase) Issues
- **No Code Base**: All documentation, zero implementation
- **Unvalidated Assumptions**: Firebase free tier usage patterns not tested
- **Template Accuracy Uncertainty**: Excel to HTML conversion feasibility unproven
- **Mobile Compatibility Unknown**: PWA performance on iOS Safari untested

### Anticipated Development Challenges
- **PDF Generation Accuracy**: Achieving pixel-perfect template reproduction
- **Offline Sync Complexity**: Conflict resolution for multi-device usage
- **German Localization**: VAT calculations, date formats, spell-check integration
- **Performance Budgets**: Maintaining <1.5s FCP with full feature set

## Metrics & Success Indicators

### Success Criteria (Go-Live)
- [ ] Invoice creation in <3 minutes (vs 15 minutes Excel)
- [ ] Search results <100ms response time
- [ ] PDF output matches Excel template exactly
- [ ] Mobile PWA installs successfully
- [ ] Firebase usage within 20% of free tier capacity

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Code coverage >80% for core components
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score >95
- [ ] Zero critical accessibility issues
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

## Resource Allocation & Timeline

### Development Timeline (4 Weeks Total)
**Week 1**: Infrastructure & Auth (Foundation)
**Week 2**: MVP Invoice System (Core Value)
**Week 3**: Search & PDF (Feature Complete)
**Week 4**: Polish & Deploy (Production Ready)

### Solo Development Approach
- **Self-Contained**: No external dependencies or team coordination
- **Iterative Progress**: Build-measure-learn cycle with weekly memory bank updates
- **Documentation First**: All changes documented in activeContext.md
- **Testing Throughout**: Quality assurance integrated from day one

## Future Enhancement Backlog

### Phase 5+: Post-MVP Features (Not Currently Scoped)
- **Photo Attachments**: Job site photo upload to invoices
- **Advanced Reporting**: Revenue forecasting, customer trends
- **Email Integration**: Direct invoice sending from platform
- **Multi-Language Support**: English version for export customers
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared customer database across employees

## Decision Log

### Key Architectural Decisions
| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 12/5/25 | Firebase over server API | Speed, cost, managed complexity | Zero server management, free tier compliance |
| 12/5/25 | React + shadcn/ui | Modern, accessible, component library aligned | Consistent UI, faster development |
| 12/5/25 | PWA over mobile app | Cross-platform, no app store complexity | iOS/Android support without native development |
| 12/5/25 | Free tier optimization | Cost control for small business | No ongoing infrastructure costs |

### Feature Rejection Log
- **Service Templates**: Rejected due to user complexity feedback
- **Social Login**: Rejected as email/password sufficient
- **Advanced Analytics**: Deferred until Phase 5 to maintain MVP focus
